## Driven Damped Pendulum (DDP)


$mL^2 \ddot{\phi} = \underbrace{-b L^2 \dot{\phi}}_{\text{torque from resistive force}} - \underbrace{mgL\sin \phi}_{\text{torque of weight}} + \underbrace{LF(t)}_{driving force}$
Assume driving force $F(t)$ is sinusoiodal. $F(T)= F_0\cos (\omega t)$

### Properties
- For a linear damped oscillator with sinusoidal driving force:
	1.  $\exists$ unique attactor which motion approaches despite initial conditions.
	2. motion of attactor itself is sinusoidal frequency (equal to drive freq)

## Near Linear Oscillations of DDP
- As drive strength is increased and nonlinearity becomes more important, pendulum will pick up various harmonics of the drive frequency $\omega$.
- DDP in linear and near linear regimes: 
	- motions approaches unique attactor as initial treansients die out 
	- then oscillates with same peroid as driver. 



## Difference in initial conditions

- for linear oscillators, its fine if initial conditions vary by some $\varepsilon$ since the error rapidly approaches zero. (insensitive to intial conditions)
- for DDP if we are close enough its fine.
